//* This scene framework contains Mod(ular)Objects, which are pairs of sets
in R^3 and name strings. You can add ModObjects, you can remove them by name
(the adding function ensures no two names are identical, save for error messages),
you can remove them by index, and you can have the whole scene rendered into
reality. Down the line, the framework will get upgraded so that each ModObject
gets an input and an output tuple of whatever it needs.
There is also currently no way to list scene contents.*//

scontents:=((S_1, n_1), ..., (S_n, n_n)), where S_i \ssub \mathbb{R}^3, n \in ST
//contains the scene's ModObjects, to be upgraded with IO
