# MathScriptRP
A repo of spells that the roleplay character Epsilon R. can make use of in her adventures.

As a reader, you are free to use this "scripting language" of sorts for the abilities of your own roleplays and characters. You are also free to contribute to these files/abilities however you see fit!

For the sake of formality: At the moment of casting, the origin is always 10cm away from the tip of Epsilon's nose. x_1 goes directly upward, x_2 goes forward and x_3 goes to the left. A unit vector corresponds to a length of 1 meter. Once a set has been created, it'll stay stationary relative to its surroundings, not relative to Epsilon. She can only create one set at a time, and creating a second set while a first one is present will cause the first set to vanish.

Setmatter is not infinitely durable; it's only as strong as the user's focus. It is infinitesimally light, though.
